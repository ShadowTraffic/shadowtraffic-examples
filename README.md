### Hello world with Kafka

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](hello-world-kafka.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fhello-world-kafka%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example writes events to a Kafka topic named `testTopic`, using JSON serialization for both the key and value. This generator doesn't specify a key, so the key of the record is always null. The value is a string, which is one of three random emojis.

### Hello world with Postgres

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](hello-world-postgres.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fhello-world-postgres%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example writes events to a Postgres table named `testTable`, which has one column named `testColumn`. If this table doesn't exist when you start ShadowTraffic, it'll automatically create it for you. `testColumn` is a string, and it's value will be one of three random emojis.

**Discussion**

This example writes events to an S3 bucket named `testBucket`. Each object in the bucket will have the file suffix `jsonl`, and each event will be one line of JSON. Events are strings, picked by the oneOf generator that chooses a random emoji.

### Hello world with a webhook

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](hello-world-webhook.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fhello-world-webhook%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example writes events to the HTTP endpoint `https://my-site/webhook-endpoint`. The shape of the generator is determined by the connection's `dataShape`. Since it's set to `kafka`, the generator is expected to create key/value data. `dataShape` can be set to other values, which lets you decouple how your data is shaped from the webhook it's sent to.

### The kitchen sink: Kafka retail data

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](kafka-retail.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fkafka-retail%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example writes events to two Kafka topics: `customers` and `orders`. Events in the `customers` topic have a map value containing a few simple attributes: `customerId`, `name`, and so on.

Events in the `orders` topic have two interesting generators. First, `customerId` is generated by a `lookup` to the `customers` topic. ShadowTraffic guarantees that any `customerId`s for `orders` will have already been successfully written to the `customers` topic.

Second, `orderNumber` is defined by the `sequentialInteger` generator. This generator is stateful, so each time it generates a value, it's internal counter increases by one. You don't need to do any state management. This happens for you automatically.

**Discussion**

This example writes events to two S3 buckets: `customers` and `orders`. Events in objects of the `customers` bucket have a few simple attributes: `customerId`, `name`, and so on.

Events in objects of the `orders` bucket have two interesting generators. First, `customerId` is generated by a `lookup` to the `customers` bucket. ShadowTraffic guarantees that any `customerId`s for `orders` will have already been successfully written to the `customers` bucket.

### Customers have a name, age, and membership level

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](basic-customer.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fbasic-customer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example generators events to a Postgres table named `customers`. The table has three rows: `name`, `age`, and `membership`.

`name` is a random full name, like John Smith.

Age is a random number between 18 and 120. By default, `uniformDistribution` generates decimal numbers. With `decimals` set to `0`, the generator instead produces integers.

`membership` is a random choice of three different levels.

**Discussion**

This example writes to a Kafka topic, with each event having a UUID key and a map value. weightedOneOf sets 57% of all candidate strings in the value to `Fraklin Roosevelt` and 43% to  `Herbert Hoover`.

### Transactions are uniformly priced between $2 and $200

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](transactions.json)

**Discussion**

This example writes to a Kafka topic named `transactions`, with each event having a UUID key and a map value. The value maps contain two attributes: `price` and `timestamp`. `price` is a random number between `2` and `200`, and is guaranteed to have two decimal places. `time` is the current UNIX time in milliseconds.

---

### Orders have a pre-existing customer

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](customers-orders.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fcustomers-orders%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example writes to two Kafka topics, `customers` and `orders.` Events in `customers` have only a key and no value—thus, value will be `null`. Events in orders have a `customerId` which is guaranteed to have been successfully written to the `customers` topic first. The `lookup` generator targets those events and uses the `path` parameter to drill into the key's `name` attribute.

### Support ticket messages arrive every 5000ms

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](support-tickets.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fsupport-tickets%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example generates events to both Kafka and Postgres.

In the first generator, straightforward events are generated to a Postgres table called `customers`. Note that because there are multiple connections, each generator has to explicitly define what connection it sends data to.

In the second generator, events are generated to a Kafka topic called `purchases`. In the value of each event, `customerId` is defined as a `lookup` to values successfully written to the `customers` table. Notice how ShadowTraffic can support lookups across connection types.

In the last generator, events are generated to a Kafka topic called `supportTickets`. This works much the same as the previous generator, but it also has a local configuration of `throttle` set. `throttle` allows this generator to only produce an event at most every `5000` milliseconds.

### Publish 80% of the tweets from 20% of the users

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](tweets.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Ftweets%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example generates data to two Kafka topics, `users` and `tweets`. In the `tweets` generator, `userId` is defined as a `lookup` to get user IDs that have been written to the `users` topic. But instead of randomly choosing previously generated user IDs, a `histogram` is used so that 20% of the user IDs will be chosen 80% of the time, and the remaining 80% of user IDs chosen 20% of the time.

This distribution holds true event as more users are generated and the pool of user IDs becomes larger.

### Send messages every 500 ms with a std dev of 40 ms

**Discussion**

This example generates events to a Kafka topic with on an uneven cadence. A variable is set named `delay`, which is about `500` milliseconds with a standard deviation of `40` milliseconds. Each time an event is generator, `delay` is evaluated to a new number. `delay` is then referenced to impose a throttle, and the actual value of delay is passed into outgoing `row.`

### Place exactly 15 orders

**Discussion**

By default, ShadowTraffic generates events indefinitely. But in this example, setting `events exactly` to a number bounds how many events are generated. When that limited is reached, ShadowTraffic stops.

### Pick a date/timestamp between yesterday and tomorrow

**Discussion**

In this example, we generate random timestamps between 24 hours into the past and 24 hours into the future—regardless of the current time. We do that by first setting a variable called `now` that captures the current wallclock time in milliseconds. Then, we create a uniformDistribution, who's lower value is now minus 24 hours and upper value is now plus 24 hours. We feed the result into `formatDateTime` to get a nice formatted string.

### 5 sensors whose value is the previous value plus a random number between -1 and 1

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](sensors.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fsensors%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example models different sensors whose previous reading influences its next reading. There are a few parts to this one.

First, each event has a `timestamp`, set in the row, that will be part of every generated event.

Second, a `stateMachine` is used to model each sensor's readings over time. In the `start` state, each sensor's initial value is set to roughly `50.` In the `update` state, which it indefinitely stays in, the reading is set by adding the previous value with a random value between `-1` and `1`.

Lastly, to model many sensors, and not just one, `fork` is used to spawn `5` simultaneous generators, each of which is spun up `250` milliseconds after the previous to make their updates stagger. A special variable called `forkKey` becomes available so that each generator can know what fork it represents—in this case, that means which sensor it is.

### Telemetry data gets randomly delayed 10% of the time, discarded 2% of the time, and repeated 5% of the time

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](telemetry.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Ftelemetry%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example generates data to a Kafka topic, but uses a few parameters to warp the data:

1. `10%` of the data is delayed from being sent out by `200 - 800` milliseconds.
2. `2%` of the data is completely discarded and never gets sent to the topic.
3. `5%` of the data is repeated twice.

All of these parameters compose, so it's conceivable that an event is repeated, with one repetition getting delayed and another getting dropped.

**Discussion**

This example generates data to mimic a subset of the [Sakila data set](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).

In the first generator, 100 forks are created to mimic 100 different stores who sell movies. The second generator, `inventory` does a `lookup` into each store ID and periodically modifies its available movies.

### A new user comes online every 250ms and changes their IP every 1 second

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/config-🎁-%2339b9aa)](ip-rotation.json)
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-🚀-%2396b939)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=707805347&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fip-rotation%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Discussion**

This example simulates events being written to a Postgres table. By contrast to other examples, this generator not only inserts rows, but also updates and deletes rows.

This generator uses a state machine to track whether a row has been initial written, and whether it's eligible to be updated or deleted. By setting the `op` key on the generator, you can change whether the event should be treated as an insert, update, or delete.

This generator uses `varsOnce` to lock each users email so that it will never change.

`stagger` is used in the `fork` section so that each new user will apparently come online every `250` milliseconds after the previous.

### 50 machines DDOSing EC2 instances in us-east-1 with ~200 byte packets every 10 ms

**Discussion**

This example simulates `50` machines sending packets to a Kafka topic.

By setting `maxForks` to `50`, this generator will be spawn parallel instances and stop when it reaches `50`. To differentiate which machine is sending packets, `sourceIP` is set to the special variable `forKey`, which represents the currently running fork.
